Glossary:

*App Service*:	An Azure PaaS option allowing developers to focus more on their apps than the underlying infrastructure. It is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It supports multiple languages and continuous deployment. While they are good for scaling, there is also a limit of up to 14 GB or 4 CPU cores on the highest tier.

*ARM Templates*:	Created within Azure Resource Manager to more easily spin up a set of given resources multiple times.

*Azure Batch*:	Used for running large-scale and high-performance compute applications beyond the capabilities of an App Service.

*Azure Functions*:	A serverless, event-driven, compute-on-demand platform (covered in a later course).

*Container Instances*:	A platform for deploying serverless docker containers (covered in a later course), without the container orchestration provided by AKS (see below).

*Service Fabric*:	Microsoft's own distributed systems platform, similar to Kubernetes.

*Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)*:	Microsoft's own platform for hosting and managing Kubernetes, including deploying docker containers into clusters (covered in a later course).
